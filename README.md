# SaaS-style-Landing-Sign-Up-Workflow

The SaaS-Style Landing Page + Sign-Up Workflow project is a full-stack web application that demonstrates the fundamental flow of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform. It combines a modern landing page design with a functional user sign-up and email verification system.

This project aims to showcase how startups or SaaS companies manage the initial user onboarding process — from visiting the product landing page to successfully creating an account and receiving an automated confirmation email.
